# PINN

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a novel approach to the integration of physical laws with deep learning, offering a promising direction for enhancing aerodynamic 
modeling and control in rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This study introduces a PINN framework specifically designed to model the complex ground effect phenomena 
encountered by rotorcraft UAVs during low-altitude operations. The Navier-Stokes equations inform the network, incorporating both the nonlinear dynamics of airflow and the 
unique aerodynamic interactions with ground surfaces~\cite{GE}. To train this network, we employ a comprehensive dataset derived from high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) simulations, capturing a wide range of operational conditions and ground proximities. This training regimen enables the PINN to learn the underlying physics of ground 
effects with high accuracy, without necessitating the extensive computational recourse typically associated with CFD simulations. Preliminary results demonstrate the PINN's 
capacity to predict aerodynamic forces and moments with significant precision, opening the way for real-time aerodynamic control applications.  
This work showcases the potential of PINNs in UAV aerodynamic modeling for their application in optimizing fight performance and safety during critical low-altitude maneuvers.
